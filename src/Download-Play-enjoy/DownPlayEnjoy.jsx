                White Gold began gaining popularity in the early 1900â€™s as an
                alternative to platinum. Platinum was steadily becoming more
                fashionable, but because of its rarity many could not afford it.
                Then, during World War II the government put a ban on the use of
                Platinum for any non-military functions and the demand for White
                Gold skyrocketed.
